# Extras

This is an additional board game that was constructed to test the modularity of the Round and View objects. You can play the game through running:
```
ruby board_game.rb.
```

This is an entirely made up game. Each player has two lanes and moves their piece in each lane to the end by inputting a starting and end point in the form of 1:2, for example. It's not a fun game to play. It was mostly created for demonstration purposes.
